646629,Skygarden central rooftop apartment,"We have a rustic rooftop apartment in the heart of Taipei, it has a private rooftop garden patio.

It's an old style Chinese building with plenty of character, so by no means shiny and polished, though with our apartment we're continually doing our best to sharpen everything up to meet the rising standards of Airbnb guests. There is only a staircase, no elevator, which is probably better given the amount of good food in the neighborhood. We have one double bed for 2 people, and can accommodate up to 4 if we set up a double foam mattresses in the living room tatami area (US$10/night will be added for more than 2 people), plus a very comfortable couch too!
